        You will always be my best friend, my greatest mentor, my motivation and my deepest roots. Your perpetual belief 
        in my limitless potentials empowers me everyday. My love for you is endless. I'm eternally grateful for the 
        knowledge you shared with me and the irreplaceable life lessons that I live by. I give you my word that I will
        fearlessly chase my dreams. I will let my light always shine bright. I will never give up and I will never back
        down from what I believe in. I will do the right things for the right reasons and I will treasure my time on this
        earth. I'm honoured to be your daughter. I am forever filled with your light and love. You are and will always
        be my greatest gift. Love always.
